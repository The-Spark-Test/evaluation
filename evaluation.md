# Standardized Testing Metrics for Humanoid Robots

A comprehensive framework for evaluating the performance and capabilities of humanoid robots.

## 1. Mobility and Flexibility

- **Range of motion**
- **Speed and acceleration**
- **Stability and balance**

## 2. Manipulation and Dexterity

- **Grasping and releasing objects**
- **Object manipulation** (e.g., rotating, twisting)
- **Fine motor skills**

## 3. Sensing and Perception

- **Object recognition**
- **Environmental awareness** (e.g., obstacle detection)
- **Sensor accuracy** (e.g., vision, lidar, tactile)

## 4. Intelligence and Autonomy

- **Task execution** (e.g., following instructions)
- **Decision-making and problem-solving**
- **Adaptability to new situations**

## 5. Human-Robot Interaction

- **Communication** (e.g., speech, gestures)
- **Understanding human emotions and intentions**
- **Safety and collision avoidance**

## 6. Power and Endurance

- **Battery life**
- **Energy efficiency**
- **Continuous operation time**

## 7. Robustness and Reliability

- **Fault tolerance**
- **Error recovery**
- **Durability in various environments**

_These metrics serve as a starting point for evaluating humanoid robots' performance and capabilities._
